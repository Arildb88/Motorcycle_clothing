## Task: Verify Cursor queue trigger safely

This is a no-production-change control-plane test.

Read the queue/guardrails/ledger and perform only these actions:
- Confirm the queue entry check succeeds for this ID.
- Do not change application code, dependencies, schema, providers, CI, or database configuration.
- Do not run API/Flutter tests, builds, analyze, or smoke.
- Record successful trigger execution in docs/agent-reports/latest.md.
- Apply the normal queue Success rule: mark this ID completed, append it to consumed.md, clear active_id, and restore next-task.md to idle.
- promotion is manual, so DO NOT promote DB-POSTGRES-001.
- Merge documentation/control changes only to dev_test and STOP.

This task exists only to verify that the updated Cursor Automation accepts the authorized trigger safely.
