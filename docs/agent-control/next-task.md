# Authorized RideWear Task
## Type: CONTROL
## ID: QUEUE-CONTROL-002
## Promoted: 2026-10-02T09:35:00Z
## Task: Harden final-handoff automation protocol

Control-plane/docs only. Design and implement a repository protocol so ordinary/mid-task pushes cannot authorize another implementation run. Define explicit handoff state/generation semantics where only a completed task's final control update may authorize a different next task ID. Preserve one-task-per-run, consumed ledger, blocker behavior, human pause, and dev/main protection.

Update guardrails.md and task-queue.md consistently. Keep the product queue paused after this control task. Restore GEO-ELEVATION-002 to queued, not consumed, and do not execute it. Do not change application code, dependencies, schema, CI, providers, or database configuration. No API/Flutter tests/builds/smoke are needed.

Document the exact replacement Cursor Agent Instructions a human must install for the new protocol. Do not assume changing GitHub actor identity solves concurrency. The trigger may remain Anyone; entry logic must reject non-final/non-authorization pushes safely.

On success mark QUEUE-CONTROL-002 completed and consumed, leave paused:true, active_id:none, promotion:manual, next-task idle, and STOP. Do not promote another task.
