# Authorized RideWear Task

## Type: IMPLEMENTATION

## ID: DB-POSTGRES-001

## Task: Implement Prisma PostgreSQL foundation

Read first:

- `docs/agent-control/guardrails.md`
- `docs/agent-control/task-queue.md`
- `docs/agent-control/consumed.md`
- `docs/agent-control/next-task.md`
- `docs/architecture/SUPABASE_POSTGRES_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

Authorized scope is sections 3 through 8 of the migration plan, and nothing beyond that plan. In particular:

- Change the Prisma datasource to `postgresql` and add Prisma 5.22 `directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")`. Do not edit models, including `Garment.isDemo`.
- Archive `apps/api/prisma/migrations` to `apps/api/prisma/migrations_sqlite` and create one reviewed PostgreSQL baseline with `prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script`. Do not replay the SQLite migration history.
- Update local development, Docker Compose, `scripts/smoke-api.sh`, and `.github/workflows/api-ci.yml` to Postgres 16, with `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` both set to that local database.
- Do not commit Supabase credentials, a Supabase host, a project ref, or a real database password.
- Do not connect to the hosted Supabase database and do not run `migrate deploy` against it. Hosted apply remains a manual operator step after local verification and after the operator confirms `public` has no application tables.

### Branch

Start from the latest `dev_test` on `feature/sqlite-to-supabase-postgres`. Do not modify `dev` or `main`.

### Verification

Follow section 8 of the migration plan, in that order. Targeted database checks only: review the baseline SQL, `migrate deploy` on empty local Postgres 16, `npm test` and `npm run build` in `apps/api`, and one smoke run against local Postgres. `api-ci` is the required GitHub repeat. No Flutter tests, Flutter analyze, or mobile build.

### Out of scope

Package upgrades, `@supabase/supabase-js`, the Data API, RLS policies, Prisma 7, `prisma.config.ts`, `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `jsonb` or enum conversions, copying SQLite files, and any Flutter change.

If local Postgres or another required tool is unavailable, mark `DB-POSTGRES-001` blocked and stop. Do not use the hosted Supabase project as a substitute database.

### Completion

Follow the queue success rule in `docs/agent-control/task-queue.md`. If promotion is automatic, promote at most the next pre-approved item and STOP.
